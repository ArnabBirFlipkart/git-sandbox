Git walkthrough by Arnab and Ganesh

This is a place to practice git. Your first exercise is to append your contact details to this list. Fork the respository, create a new branch and add your details and send a pull request. Your entry should maintain the alphabetic order and it should be in a tabular format. In case of multiple commits, make sure to squash your commits before sending a Pull Request.
